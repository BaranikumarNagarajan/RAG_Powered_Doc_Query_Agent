# Repository cleanup summary

This file documents repository cleanup actions performed locally.

What was removed or fixed
- `.venv/` (local virtual environment) was untracked from git and then deleted from disk to avoid repository bloat.
- `repo.git/` (accidental nested git metadata) was removed from the index and deleted from disk.
- `__pycache__/` directories and `*.pyc` files were removed from the working tree and disk.
- `.env` and `server/.env` were removed from the index (now untracked). Note: these files may still exist in git history if they were committed earlier.
- `.gitignore` was updated to include rules for `.venv/` and `repo.git/` to prevent future accidental commits.

Commits created locally
- chore(cleanup): untrack .venv, remove repo.git, untrack .env and __pycache__, update .gitignore
- chore(cleanup): remove accidental nested repo.git from repository index
- chore(cleanup): ensure .gitignore ignores .venv and repo.git

Recommended next steps

1. If any `.env` files contained secrets, consider rewriting history with a tool like `git filter-repo` or BFG and then force-pushing. This is destructive to history and requires coordination with collaborators.
2. Update the remote repository URL (if needed) and push the cleanup commits. The current origin will be updated to the repo name `RAG_Powered_Doc_Query_Agent` upon request.
3. Recreate a clean virtual environment locally (example):

```powershell
# from repo root
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want me to push these changes to GitHub, confirm that the remote repository `RAG_Powered_Doc_Query_Agent` exists under your account or provide the correct URL and authentication method (HTTPS with PAT or SSH key).

If you want me to purge `.env` values from history before pushing, confirm and I'll proceed with guidance and the rewrite (requires force-push).

-- cleanup automated on your machine

Post-merge cleanup note
-----------------------

The repository history was rewritten and a clean root commit was pushed to `origin/main` to remove large
binary files (notably Python virtual environment artifacts under `.venv/`). A backup branch named
`backup/pre-force-main` was created pointing to the previous remote history before the forced update. If
you collaborate with others, let them know they should re-clone or run `git fetch origin && git reset --hard
origin/main` to sync with the rewritten history.

If you want me to remove other paths from history (for example specific large files or accidental commits),
I can run a targeted history rewrite (git filter-repo or BFG) and force-push again — confirm before I
proceed.

Repository cleanup summary

What I removed or untracked

- Removed tracked Python virtual environment `.venv/` from the repository index and deleted the local `.venv/` directory to free space.
- Removed accidental nested git directory `repo.git/` from the index and deleted it from disk.
- Removed Python cache directories `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` files from disk and from the index.
- Untracked `.env` and `server/.env` so local secret files are not accidentally committed in the future.

What I changed

- Updated `.gitignore` to include `repo.git/` and ensure `.venv/` and dotenv files are ignored.
- Created two cleanup commits documenting the untracked/deleted files.
- Added this `CLEANUP.md` file to explain what was done and provide guidance.

Recommendations

- Do NOT push history-sensitive files (.env) without first checking for secrets. If secrets were committed previously, consider rewriting history (git filter-repo or BFG) and force-pushing.
- Recreate your virtual environment locally using `python -m venv .venv` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- If you want the remote refreshed on GitHub, provide the correct repository URL or set up authentication (PAT/SSH). I attempted to push to `origin`, but the push failed with "Repository not found." — this usually means the remote repo doesn't exist or you lack permission.

If you'd like me to push the cleanup now, provide the correct remote URL or allow me to set origin to `https://github.com/BaranikumarNagarajan/AI-DocQuery.git` and authenticate. If you need me to rewrite history to remove secrets, confirm and I'll walk through the steps and consequences.
